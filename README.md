Perorming a anaylsis of theater campaigns to discover trends

## Overview
The purpose of analysis is to help Louise understand how well other plays performed based on launch dates and goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
Louise campaigned for a play called "Fever" and came close to her fundraising goal. She wants to know how well other plays achieved their goals based on launch date of the campaign as well as the fundraising goal. I have collected data from campaigns in wide range of categories. I had to first down campaigns to those for plays. I also had to filter out campaigns that were still running. The data collected is in attached Excel spreadsheet in Kickstarter Analysis File. The data has too much information not all relating to Louise's campaign of play. Used Excel tools to create charts to look at dates and goals of related subcategory of completed campaigns. 

First chart shows successful and failed outcomes bacsed on date campaign launched.

The second chart shows the sucessful and failed outcomes based on fundraising goals of campaigns.

## Results
Based on the peak of successful plays in line graph "Theater Outcomes vs Launch", May is a very clear choice of when Louise shoud begin her campaign. Also, the steep increase of successful plays compared to slight increase of failed plays during this month gives an indication that time does influence the outcome of campaigns and May is clearly the best option. Looking at the data collected based on fundraiser goal amounts it is clear that as the dollar amount increases the successful outcome decreases. From this we can conclude that the smaller the dollar amount the better the chances of being successful. Other than being in May we can also conclude to lower the dollar amount as much as possible to below $5000. However, the graph does not show that as the dollar amount increases the number of data points decreases and I do not have a large population of data to represent dollar amounts in the higher range. I would like to have gathered more data from campaigns in higher range of goal amounts. Even with the limitation of data I am optimistic as the subcategory of plays had more sucesses than almost all other subcategories but could look into more data of places, audiences and genres using addtional line graphs to be more certain.
